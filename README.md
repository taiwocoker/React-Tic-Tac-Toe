# React Tic-Tac-Toe

> The first player, who shall be designated a heart sign, has 3 possible strategically distinct positions to mark during the first turn, This applies also to the second player that also has a cross sign. Each player takes turn to play until It has the same sign Vertically or diagonally or horizontally.Then there is a winner OR a draw.

Future Improvements:
- To show the number of wins for each player until there is a reset.
- To have more than 2 players.
